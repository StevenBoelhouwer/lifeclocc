## What's this repo about?
This is the open source repository for the code and schematics for making lifeclocc.

Here you will find the code powering lifeclocc, the 3D models for the various parts, as well as the schematics for the PCBs.

Unfortunately, this is still incomplete. I'll upload all this at some point in the future hopefully.
